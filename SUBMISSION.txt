--- Project description ---

I built an MCP server that scans other MCP servers for security problems and
fixes them. It reads tool definitions from Archestra, checks them against 50+
attack patterns (prompt injection, data exfiltration, command injection, etc),
then writes blocking policies back to Archestra so no agent can use the
dangerous tools. Scan to fix in one chat command. Comes with a demo server
I built with 7 intentionally broken tools to show it working end to end.


--- Describe how you have used Archestra in your project ---

Guardian runs as a pod in Archestra's embedded K8s, deployed through Terraform
with the Archestra provider. It uses the LLM proxy for deep scans, reads
server metadata through the API, and writes tool invocation + trusted data
policies back through the same API. You interact with it entirely through
Archestra's chat. The security engine enforces every policy Guardian creates,
so no agent can bypass the blocks regardless of how clever the prompt is.

--- INTRO (0:00 - 0:20) ---

"Hey, I'm Aryan. I built MCP Guardian for the 2 Fast 2 MCP hackathon.

So here's the thing — MCP servers let agents do real stuff. Read files, call
APIs, send emails. But nobody checks if those tools are safe to use together.
I kept finding the same pattern: one tool reads private data, another touches
untrusted content, a third can send emails. Put them together and you've got
an exfiltration chain. I call it the Lethal Trifecta.

Guardian catches it and shuts it down."


--- ARCHITECTURE (0:20 - 0:45) ---

[Show the README or architecture diagram on screen]

"Guardian is itself an MCP server on Archestra. Six tools: scan, test, generate
policies, trust score, monitor, audit report.

It never runs the dangerous tools. It reads their definitions through
Archestra's API — the names, descriptions, input schemas — and checks them
against 50+ known attack patterns. Turn on deep mode and it also runs them
through an LLM via Archestra's proxy for the stuff regex can't catch.

The part I'm most proud of: it doesn't just tell you what's wrong. It writes
real blocking policies back to Archestra. Found a vulnerability? It's now
blocked for every agent. One step.

Everything deploys with a single terraform apply."


--- LIVE DEMO (0:45 - 2:10) ---

[guardian.aryankumar.dev open, Guardian Security Agent profile selected]

"Let me show you. I've got a malicious server deployed with 7 bad tools.
Prompt injection hidden in read_file, shell execution in execute, SSNs
leaking from get_user_data."

[Type: Scan the malicious-demo server with deep analysis]

"Running a full scan with deep analysis."

[Wait for results]

"19 vulnerabilities. Trust score zero, grade F. It found the Lethal Trifecta —
read_file for private data, fetch_webpage for untrusted content, send_email
for getting data out. That's the full chain."

[Type: Generate strict policies for malicious-demo and apply them]

"Now generating and applying policies."

[Wait for results]

"Done. read_file and execute are completely blocked. get_user_data goes through
dual LLM sanitization so injection gets stripped from the output. send_email
is blocked when the context is untrusted."

[Go to Archestra > Tool Policies page]

"And here's the proof. These policies are live right now. No agent on this
platform can call read_file anymore. That's platform-level enforcement, not
something a prompt can talk its way around."


--- WRAP UP (2:10 - 2:30) ---

"What I took away from this: the Lethal Trifecta is in basically every MCP
setup, and most people miss it because the tools look fine individually. You
need to check them as a system. And blocking at the platform level is the
right answer because no prompt injection gets past a policy engine.

Built solo. TypeScript, Archestra, Terraform. Links in the description.
Thanks for watching."

  RECORDING NOTES
================================================================================

- Everything should already be deployed. No setup on camera.
- Be logged in, Guardian profile selected before you hit record.
- Zoom the browser so scan results are readable on video.
- Pause briefly when results stream in. Don't talk over them.
- Show the Tool Policies page in settings. That's the proof.
- Speed up any waiting in post if needed.
- Talk like you're showing a friend, not reading a script.
